DSP Nexus (RouteSync) 🚛 ⚡ 🤖The "Digital Twin" Fleet Intelligence Platform for Amazon Delivery Service Partners.DSP Nexus is a next-generation logistics tool designed to solve the chaos of the daily dispatch parking lot. Unlike simple checklists, it uses a Route-First Architecture to link temporary daily assignments (Routes) with permanent assets (Vans & Drivers), creating a complete digital twin of the operation.🚀 Key Features🧠 AI-Powered Architecture (Powered by Gemini)Schema Architect: interactively visualize and expand the database schema using AI suggestions.Smart Analysis: Click any data node (e.g., "Vans Table") to get AI-driven insights on its operational value and analytics potential.Mock Data Generator: Instantly generate realistic Amazon DSP test data (e.g., "Route CX144", "Van T12") for prototyping.Natural Language Query: Ask the "Architect" chat interface to write SQL or explain complex data flows.🔄 Route-First & Temporal LogicDaily Restart Simulation: Implements the core business rule where Route IDs (e.g., CX120) are unique only for a single day.Asset Persistence: Simulates the "New Day" transition where dynamic logs (Routes, Rosters) are archived/cleared while static assets (Drivers, Vans) persist.Composite Keys: Enforces data integrity using [Date] + [Route_ID] logic.📱 Operational workflowsVisual "Snake Walk": Sorts dispatch lists by physical parking lot topography (Rows 1-2) for efficient walking paths.The "3-Step Chain": Visualizes the critical dependency flow: Route -> Driver -> Van.🛠️ Tech StackFrontend: React 18Styling: Tailwind CSS (Glassmorphism UI)AI Integration: Google Gemini API (Flash 1.5)Visualization: SVG + React Draggable Nodes📦 InstallationClone the repo:git clone [https://github.com/yourusername/dsp-nexus.git](https://github.com/yourusername/dsp-nexus.git)
Install dependencies:npm install
Add your API Key:Create a .env file and add REACT_APP_GEMINI_API_KEY=your_key_hereRun the Architect:npm start
🔮 Future Roadmap[ ] Flutter Mobile App: Offline-first mobile client for parking lot dispatchers.[ ] Supabase Integration: Moving the schema from visual prototype to actual PostgreSQL backend.[ ] Predictive Maintenance: Using historical "Issues Log" data to block assignments of faulty vans.🤝 ContributingContributions are welcome! Please focus on the Route_ID constraints when submitting PRs regarding the data model.Designed for the modern Amazon DSP.
